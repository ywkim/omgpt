## üìö Introduction

Welcome to **OMGpt Shell**! üëã

OMGpt Shell is a revolutionary AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) aiming to make your interaction with your computer's shell environment as intuitive and efficient as possible.

While traditional shell environments like bash, zsh, and fish require specific commands and syntaxes that can be difficult to memorize and use, OMGpt Shell lets you control your computer in a more human way: by using natural language commands.

Think of OMGpt Shell as your personal command-line assistant. Instead of having to remember and type out specific shell commands, you can just tell OMGpt Shell what you want to do in in your preferred language. OMGpt Shell's powerful AI will interpret your command and translate it into the appropriate shell command.

OMGpt Shell can greatly simplify the process of interacting with your computer's shell environment, whether you're a beginner just learning the ropes or a seasoned power user looking for a more efficient way to work. Try OMGpt Shell today and experience the future of command-line interfaces! üöÄ

## ‚≠ê Features

OMGpt Shell is an AI-powered command line interface designed to make your interaction with the shell more intuitive and efficient. Here are some of the key features:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: OMGpt Shell uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand your commands. This allows you to interact with the shell in your preferred language, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

2. **Wide Range of Command Support**: From simple file operations to complex tasks like networking or system management, OMGpt Shell can translate your natural language commands into the appropriate shell commands. This reduces the need to remember specific command syntax and increases productivity.

3. **Command History**: OMGpt Shell keeps track of the commands you've used, allowing you to easily revisit and reuse them. This feature enhances efficiency and allows for easy repetition of commands.

4. **Directory Navigation**: Easily navigate through your file system with simple commands. OMGpt Shell understands your directory change commands, making file system navigation a breeze.

5. **Streaming Responses**: Get real-time feedback from OMGpt Shell. As GPT processes your commands, the responses are streamed back to you, keeping you informed every step of the way.

6. **Full Output Feature**: If you want to see the full output of the last executed command, simply press Ctrl + O. This will show you the complete standard output or error, providing you with all the details you need.

7. **Output Toggle Feature**: By default, OMGpt Shell hides the standard output of the executed commands. However, if you want to toggle the visibility of the output for future commands, you can simply press Ctrl + T.

8. **Auto-Completion for File and Directory Paths**: OMGpt Shell supports auto-completion for file and directory paths. As you start typing a path, OMGpt Shell will suggest possible completions, making it faster and easier to enter paths.

9. **Non-Interactive Mode**: OMGpt Shell supports a non-interactive mode, allowing you to use it in scripts or batch jobs, or to execute a single command without entering the interactive shell environment.

10. **Examples of use**:

   - **Example 1**: When you say, "Download the file at 'http://example.com/file' and save it as 'downloaded_file'", OMGpt Shell will execute the following:
     ```bash
     wget -O downloaded_file http://example.com/file
     ```
     If you want to see the full output of this command, press Ctrl + O. If you want to toggle the visibility of the output for future commands, press Ctrl + T.

   - **Example 2**: If you tell OMGpt Shell to "Find all the Python files in the current directory", it will execute:
     ```bash
     find . -name "*.py"
     ```
   - **Example 3**: If you say, "Check the current status of git, track and commit the newly written source code with a nice commit message", OMGpt Shell will run:
     ```bash
     git status
     git add .
     git commit -m "Automatically committed by OMGpt Shell"
     ```
   - **Example 4**: If you start typing the name of a file or directory and then press Tab, OMGpt Shell will auto-complete the path for you. For example, if you have a file named 'example.txt' in the current directory, you can just type 'exa' and then press Tab to auto-complete the file name.

By transforming your natural language inputs into appropriate shell commands, OMGpt Shell makes the process of working with a shell more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install OMGpt Shell using pip. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.

```bash
pip install omgpt
```

## üéØ Usage

After installation, using OMGpt Shell is simple:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Start OMGpt Shell by running the following command:

   ```bash
   omgpt
   ```

3. You'll now be in the OMGpt Shell interface. Here, instead of typing regular shell commands, you can issue commands in your preferred language. For example:

   ```bash
   > Download the file at 'http://example.com/file' and save it as 'downloaded_file'
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   > Find all the Python files in the current directory
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   > Check the current status of git, track and commit the newly written source code with a nice commit message
   ```

4. To use non-interactive mode, pass your command as an argument when starting OMGpt Shell. For example:

   ```bash
   omgpt -c "Download the file at 'http://example.com/file' and save it as 'downloaded_file'"
   ```

   This will start OMGpt Shell, execute the given command, and then exit. The output will be the same as if you had entered the command in interactive mode.

Remember, the goal of OMGpt Shell is to understand your commands in your preferred language and convert them to appropriate shell commands.

## üîß Configuration

To customize your user experience with OMGpt, you need to create a configuration file named `~/.omgptrc` in your home directory.

Here's a simple example of what your `~/.omgptrc` might look like:

```ini
[api]
openai_api_key = <your-openai-api-key>

[settings]
chat_model = gpt-4-0613
```

### Required Settings

The only required setting to run OMGpt properly is the OpenAI API Key:

- `openai_api_key`: You are required to input your OpenAI API key. This allows OMGpt to communicate with the OpenAI API. You can get your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com).

### Optional Settings

These optional settings customize OMGpt to better suit your needs:

- `chat_model`: Specifies the chat model that OMGpt will use. This includes "gpt-4-0613" and "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", among others. If it's not specified, a default model will be used. You should verify the availability of these models in your API subscription.

- `system_prompt`: Sets the behavior of the model used. The prompt should instruct the model about its function and how to generate responses. For instance, "You are a shell. Your name is OMGpt. You treat their time as precious. You are as concise as possible in responses. You need to run the next command sequentially, depending on the result of the previous command, without prompting the user if necessary. You should run a command to get information about system. Use friendly, appropriate emoticons when responding to users."

- `temperature`: Controls the diversity of the model's responses. A higher value (nearer to 1) produces more various outputs, while a lower value creates more deterministic responses.

After modifying your `~/.omgptrc`, don't forget to save it and restart OMGpt for the changes to apply. More details about the models and their behaviors can be found in the [official OpenAI API documentation](https://docs.openai.com/en/).
